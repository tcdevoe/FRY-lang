FRY Programming Language
========
This is a small (see incomplete) Domain Specific Language I wrote for COMS W4115 at Columbia. The main objective of FRY is the ability to write succinct data transformations for flat file processing. It utilizes set-builder notation and the concept of a delimited text file as a relational "table" to achieve that. In any case, it is most certainly incomplete and was seriously rushed as I was working on this alone, but it is still an interesting project. I have no plans on continuing work on this project as the class has finished. 

For more information about FRY, please see the [FRY Language Manual](docs/TomDeVoe_FinalReport.pdf).
